## Essential Questions and Reflections

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?  
Understanding user needs begins with clear communication and active collaboration with stakeholders. User stories are invaluable in this process, as they break down user needs into manageable, actionable tasks. These stories keep development user-focused by specifying who the feature is for, what they need, and why they need it. For example, in the SNHU Travel project, we decomposed the "Search Flights" feature into smaller user stories, such as "Search by Departure Date" and "Filter by Price Range," which ensured stakeholder priorities were met incrementally. 📚

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?  
My development approach emphasizes adaptability and collaboration. The iterative nature of Agile processes, such as Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, and Retrospectives, provides the structure to align the team and prioritize high-value work. Moving forward, I aim to incorporate these processes to maintain transparency, foster continuous improvement, and ensure that programs remain aligned with user needs. Tools like JIRA and Confluence have proven invaluable for tracking progress and centralizing documentation. 🔄

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?  
A good team member fosters collaboration, communicates effectively, and remains accountable for their contributions. It’s about more than just technical skills—being adaptable, respectful, and proactive in addressing challenges is equally important. For instance, during the SNHU Travel project, we resolved blockers collaboratively, such as troubleshooting API integration issues for the "View Itinerary" feature. This ensured steady progress and maintained team morale. 🤝
